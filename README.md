# E-COMMERCE-PROJECT 

#Introduction

Welcome to the Ecommerce Project README! This project is a simple e-commerce website developed using HTML, CSS, React.js, and PHP. It is primarily focused on the frontend functionality for displaying dummy products and providing user registration with email and password. The backend, in this case, is used solely for user registration and does not include full e-commerce functionality.

#Project #Overview

The project's main goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and view dummy products. Additionally, it offers user registration and login functionality using PHP to store user data securely. However, please note that this project is a basic demonstration and does not include features such as real product purchases or a complete backend for handling e-commerce transactions.

#Technologies #Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.
React.js: For creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
PHP: For handling user registration and storing user information.
Dummy Products: Placeholder data for showcasing products (not linked to a real product database).

#Getting #Started

#Prerequisites
